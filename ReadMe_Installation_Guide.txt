codes for configuration set up into the installed Docker Container
6. Type ‘R’ and press the ‘Enter key’ on the keyboard to proceed with data import following the second

8. Upon completion, the SEAIT platform launches on the system browser Locally with the default Admin 
view. Set up two different accounts by registering SysAdmin and Admin accounts.
i. The first account registered defaults to the SysAdmin account where all the SEAIT data are hosted.
ii. The second account registered defaults to the Admin account where the Group evaluation is managed 
including the unique group assessment code generation (click group code > Edit > generate > Add)
which is required to start group assessment and viewing of group assessment results.
9. The evaluation and admin views can be called up locally by appending them to the local host address
generated. For instance, the views and snapshots from my system are: http://localhost:5000/admin and
http://localhost:5000/evaluation
Admin/SysAdmin view displayed using the local address: http://localhost:5000/admin
Evaluation view displayed using the local address: http://localhost:5000/evaluation
